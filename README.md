# WSL1 setup

This script is intended for my personal use only, but if you want to tweak it for *your* 
personal use read along.

Go through wsl_setup.sh file in this repo, it is like the main() function of this setup program.

The bin directory contains all the executables that I need in my User's PATH. This may include
binaries like `hugo` or bash scripts that simply everyday work.

The scripts  directory contain fragments of code to be inserted in `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile`,
as well as config files like .vimrc and .tmux.conf.
